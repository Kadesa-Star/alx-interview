Key Concepts:
File I/O in Python:

Utilize sys.stdin to read input line by line. This allows your program to process data dynamically as it is provided, which is essential for real-time log processing​

.
The typical way to read input from stdin is using a loop:
python
Copy code
import sys
for line in sys.stdin:
    # Process each line
Signal Handling:

Implement signal handling to gracefully exit your program upon receiving a keyboard interrupt (e.g., CTRL + C). This is crucial for ensuring that your program can terminate without causing data corruption or leaving resources in an uncertain state​

Use the signal module to catch SIGINT and perform cleanup if necessary.
Data Processing:

You'll be parsing each log entry to extract relevant data points. Regular expressions can be very useful here for validating and extracting specific fields from your log format​

Aggregate data using Python's built-in data structures, like lists and dictionaries, to compute summaries, such as counting occurrences of different status codes or calculating total file sizes.
Regular Expressions:

Employ the re module to handle string parsing efficiently. Regular expressions allow you to define search patterns for validating the format of each line​

Dictionaries:

Use dictionaries to store counts and sums. For instance, you can track the number of occurrences of various HTTP status codes and total file sizes for specific requests​

Exception Handling:

Be prepared to handle exceptions that may arise during file reading or data processing, such as formatting errors or unexpected input​
