Problem Statement
You are given a 2D grid (matrix) where:

Each cell in the grid has a value of either 0 (water) or 1 (land).
An island is a group of 1s (land cells) connected horizontally or vertically. There is exactly one island in the grid.
The grid is completely surrounded by water, and there are no lakes (water inside the island that isnâ€™t connected to the boundary water).
The goal is to calculate the perimeter of this island.
