Key Concepts to Master:
Lists and List Manipulation:

You'll likely represent the boxes as a list of lists. Each sublist will contain the keys available in that particular box.
You'll need to access and manipulate these lists efficiently to determine which boxes can be unlocked.
Graph Theory Basics:

This problem can be viewed as a graph traversal where each box is a node and each key is an edge connecting to another node (box). Understanding graph traversal algorithms like DFS (Depth-First Search) or BFS (Breadth-First Search) will help you explore all reachable boxes.
You’ll need to explore all possible boxes and ensure that you have unlocked every single one.
Algorithmic Complexity:

You need to consider the time complexity of your algorithm. Using the wrong approach could lead to inefficiency, especially if there are a large number of boxes and keys.
Both DFS and BFS have a time complexity of O(V + E), where V is the number of boxes and E is the number of keys (edges).
Recursion:

If you choose to implement DFS recursively, you'll need a good understanding of recursion. DFS can be either recursive or iterative (using a stack).
Queue and Stack:

DFS can be implemented using a stack, and BFS can be implemented using a queue. You’ll choose one of these based on how you prefer to traverse the boxes and collect keys.
Set Operations:

You’ll need to keep track of which boxes have been visited (unlocked). A set is a good data structure for this because it allows for fast lookups (O(1) time complexity).
Possible Approach:
Initialize:

Start with box 0 unlocked.
Maintain a set of keys you've collected.
Maintain a set of visited boxes.
Traversal:

Use either DFS or BFS to traverse through the boxes.
For each box you unlock, collect all the keys it contains.
Use those keys to unlock other boxes.
Continue until you’ve unlocked as many boxes as possible.
Check:

At the end of the traversal, check if you’ve unlocked all the boxes.
